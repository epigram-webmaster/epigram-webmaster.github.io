It offends our sense of fair play, undermines our trust in politicians, civil servants and the voting system, and is destructive of that bedrock of our society, our democracy.  The Mother of Parliaments has been filled for the past three years with scheming, anti-democratic, careerist party functionaries, not respecting and implementing a people’s vote and betraying the nation.  We simply do not want to find that we have re-formed a House of Commons that is once again Remain-dominated after this election.  The country is crying out for change and an end to the Punch & Judy politics of Labour and the Tories.”  As well as Brexit,  his main policies centre around electoral reform and a fairer funding system for Bristol to aid businesses and individuals.</div>

      He told Cornwall Live: ‘Whether you are in South Bristol or some parts of Cornwall the issues that matter to people are the same. In these areas there is a lot of poverty. People worry about the NHS, mental health provision, social care and employment opportunities.
      ‘I'm looking forward to meeting the people of South Bristol and find out what the issues that matter to them are. There is so much division in the country at the moment it’s more important to have the right heart.
      ‘The Conservatives don't care about the issues that matter to people. Brexit is important as there are so many things we can't do so long as we're still inside the EU.
      ‘There are too many career politicians who are not interested in what goes on outside the Westminster bubble. But people are feeling disenfranchised. We have real people in the Brexit Party with real jobs.’</div>
